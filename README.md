# Gambit Card Generator

Takes data stored in gambits.json and renders styled cards that can be printed and cut out, displaying all the requisite information. Intended to be used in a homebrew modification of the Hellscapes RPG, which itself is based on D&D 5e. Runs entirely in the browser, building a full-stack app for this would have been overkill and a waste of my time.

## Roadmap

This project is basically done. The only thing that may change in the future is minor tweaks to the gambits file, but the basic functionality is where it needs to be.

## Build and Run

`git clone https://github.com/spitemonster/gambit-cards.git`

`cd gambit-cards`

`npm install`

Open the HTML file in your browser or host on whatever server you feel like.

## Notes

Icons from iconmonstr.

Hellscapes is (partially, given that it is based on the D&D 5e SRD) the creation of Scrivened LLC. and Ryan Chaddock. I think it's reasonable to note that Ryan Chaddock has been accused of sexual misconduct. I don't have the time or capacity to fully research this subject and even if I did it would not be my place to judge the guilt or innocence of any involved.
